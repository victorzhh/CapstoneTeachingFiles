<!-- HEADERS -->
    <h1>This is a Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>This is a Heading 2</h2><h4>Headings are blocks that display on their own line</h4>
<!-- Experiment what - what is the smallest heading number? What happens if you try <h100> which is clearly not a real thing? -->


<!-- Check out how this part looks in the browser or preview -->
This is a bunch of untagged text
Because it is untagged there won't be any separation


Even if I put a space above this.


You see what I mean?
This is all a continuous paragraph.


<!-- P TAGS! -->
    <p>With paragraph tags I can create separation</p>
    <p> Next paragraph please!</p>
<!-- Go back and add some <p> and </p> tags to break up the preceeding text -->
<!-- Experiment! What happens if you use just an opening tag, or just a closing tag? -->




<!-- IN-LINE TAGS-->
    <p>New semantics: <strong>strong</strong> <em>emphasized</em></p>
<!-- Can you figure out how to make something bold AND italicized? -->


<!-- LOREM -->
<!-- Use lorem+Tab or lorem+Enter to quickly get filler text! Try it out-->


<!-- OTHER TAGS -->
<!-- Link for all the elements/tags, look through them and experiment with 3 new tags! -->
